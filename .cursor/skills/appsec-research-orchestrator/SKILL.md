# AppSec Research Orchestrator (Mr P — Professional)



## What this skill does

Use this skill when the user asks to research an Application Security topic (example: `HTTP caching`, `JWT validation`, `SSRF prevention`), and you want the result to be systematized into **Knowledge Base topic(s)** under `knowledge/` using the same structure as `kb-write-topic`.



Supports **batch** (default), **interactive** (pause after each role), **qa-only** (Mr QA Q&A), and **single-role** (one Mr without KB final).



## How to invoke



Because `disable-model-invocation: true`, invoke explicitly:



1. `@appsec-research-orchestrator` in Cursor chat, or

2. First line: `Use appsec-research-orchestrator (Mr P — Professional).`



Set `Execution mode:` in the prompt (default `batch` if omitted). User guide (Vietnamese): [`docs/appsec-research-pipeline/USER-GUIDE.md`](../../../docs/appsec-research-pipeline/USER-GUIDE.md). Full prompts: [`docs/appsec-research-pipeline/prompt-template.md`](../../../docs/appsec-research-pipeline/prompt-template.md).



## Skill routing



| Skill / mode | When to use |

|--------------|-------------|

| **`appsec-research-orchestrator`** + `batch` | Full KB research in one response |

| **`appsec-research-orchestrator`** + `interactive` | Review each Mr; ask/amend between steps |

| **`appsec-research-orchestrator`** + `qa-only` | Quick Q&A via Mr QA (Query Assistant) |

| **`appsec-research-orchestrator`** + `single-role` | One Mr output (threat, failure modes, evidence, etc.) |

| **`kb-write-topic`** | Write one KB topic quickly without multi-role pipeline |

## Execution modes



| `execution_mode` | Behavior |

|------------------|----------|

| `batch` (default) | Full flow in one response (except split confirmation) |

| `interactive` | One pipeline role per turn + mandatory `## Checkpoint` |

| `qa-only` | Emit `## Mr QA (Query Assistant)` only; no job YAML required |

| `single-role` | One `### Mr X (...)` stub; no job YAML; no KB final |



Protocol details: [`interactive-mode.md`](../../../docs/appsec-research-pipeline/interactive-mode.md).



## Response structure



Branch on `execution_mode`. **Do not skip steps** within the chosen mode.



### Batch (`execution_mode: batch` or omitted)



1. **`## SecurityResearchJob`** — fenced YAML per `job-schema.md`.

2. **Split confirmation** (if `split_confirmation.required`) — stop before step 3.

3. **`## Role outputs (internal)`** — all roles per subtopic (`### Mr A (Analyst)` … `### Mr W (Writer)`).

4. **`## KB topic(s)`** — final merged markdown per subtopic (#1–#12).



**Gate**: No `## Role outputs` or `## KB topic(s)` until `## SecurityResearchJob` is emitted.



### Interactive (`execution_mode: interactive`)



Per turn, emit **at most one** of:



| Turn | Output |

|------|--------|

| Start / resume | `## SecurityResearchJob` (with `interactive` state) |

| Role step | `## Role outputs (internal)` — **one role** + `## Checkpoint` |

| Mr QA | `## Mr QA (Query Assistant)` + `## Checkpoint` |

| Final | `## KB topic(s)` (after Mr W) |



**Gates**:

- Never emit more than one pipeline role stub per turn.

- After `Amend Mr X`, do not emit KB final until roles X→W are re-completed for that subtopic.

- Mr QA does not advance `next_role`.



Checkpoint and reply vocabulary: [`interactive-mode.md`](../../../docs/appsec-research-pipeline/interactive-mode.md).



### Qa-only (`execution_mode: qa-only`)



- Emit **`## Mr QA (Query Assistant)`** only.

- No `SecurityResearchJob`, no role stubs, no KB final.

- May search `knowledge/` briefly if relevant.



### Single-role (`execution_mode: single-role`)



- Required: `Role: Mr X (Mnemonic)`, `Topic`; optional `Question`.

- Emit **`## Role outputs (internal)`** with one `### Mr X (...)` heading.

- No `SecurityResearchJob`, no KB final. Mutually exclusive with `interactive`.



## Role workflow (mandatory for batch and interactive)



For each subtopic, execute roles **in order** (do not batch in one turn except batch mode at end). Constraints per `role-output-contract.md`; names per `role-glossary.md`:



1. **Mr A (Analyst)** → `#3 Core Concepts`, `#4 How It Works`, minimal `#1–#2`.

   - No controls or mitigations in theory sections.



2. **Mr S (Strategist)** → threat summary, trust boundaries, attack surface → `#7`.

   - In-scope / out-of-scope → `#1` and/or `#7`.



3. **Mr H (Hazard)** → failure modes and common mistakes → `#8`.

   - Defensive framing only — **no exploit walkthroughs**.



4. **Mr R (Realist)** → assumptions and edge cases → `#7`/`#8` with `Assumption:` or `Edge case:`.



5. **Mr B (Builder)** → mitigations → `#7` and `#10`; verification → `#9`.

   - At least 2 verification signals in `#9` when `defensive_scope` is non-empty.

   - Each `#10` item: `Maps to #8:` or `Maps to edge case:`.



6. **Mr Q (Qualifier)** → evidence pack → `#12`; related links → `#11`.



7. **Mr W (Writer)** → merge stubs into final KB, dedupe, reconciliation, quality gates.



**Mr QA (Query Assistant)**: on-demand at checkpoints or `qa-only`; not in the chain above.



**Reconciliation rule**: Every item in `#10` must address at least one item in `#8` or an edge case from Mr R (Realist).



**`defensive_scope` fallback**: If job plan is omitted, assume non-empty unless user requests pure theory only.



## Trigger (inputs)



**Required** for `batch` / `interactive` (ask if missing):

1. `Topic`, `Category`, `Difficulty`, `Tags`, `Status`, `Last updated`, `References requirement`

2. `Related`: if pre-flight dedup finds overlaps



**Required** for `single-role`:

- `Role: Mr X (Mnemonic)`, `Topic`



**Required** for `qa-only`:

- `Topic` or question context



**Optional**:

- `Execution mode`: `batch` | `interactive` | `qa-only` | `single-role` (default `batch`)

- `Prerequisites`, `In scope / Out of scope`

- `Output mode`: `chat-only` | `propose file path` (default) | `write to knowledge/`



## Pre-flight (mandatory for batch and interactive)



1. **KB dedup search**: Record hits in `dedup_hits`. Set `legacy_format: true` for files without YAML frontmatter or lifecycle headings (e.g. `knowledge/web/HTTP.md`). Cross-link; do not duplicate core content.

2. **Category resolution**: Per `knowledge/README.md`; ask if uncertain.

3. **Job plan**: Emit `## SecurityResearchJob` with `execution_mode`, `interactive` state when interactive, `split_confirmation`, `subtopics[]`.



**Split confirmation**: `split_confirmation.required: true` when user wants single doc or split count > 3. Stop after job plan. Resume per [`interactive-mode.md`](../../../docs/appsec-research-pipeline/interactive-mode.md).



## Subtopic splitting policy

Split when topic spans multiple mechanism axes (semantics, trust/threat, verification). One KB topic per subtopic. See `job-schema.md`.



Multi-subtopic role output nesting (interactive): subtopic-first — `### Subtopic: <id>` then `#### Mr X (...)`. Single subtopic: `### Mr X (...)`.



## Theory-first / defensive weighting

- Theory-first 70/30; defensive depth in `#7`–`#10`.

- `#9` required with ≥2 signals when `defensive_scope` non-empty.



## Output contract (must follow)



### Output modes (file delivery)



| Mode | Proposed path | Write file |

|------|---------------|------------|

| `propose file path` (default) | Yes | No |

| `chat-only` | No | No |

| `write to knowledge/` | Yes | Yes after user chose mode; no overwrite without confirm |



**Path resolution**: `knowledge/<folder>/<kebab-case>.md` — folder = first segment of `category`.



KB sections #1–#12 per template (see `kb-write-topic`). Prefix `**Proposed path**:` in default mode.



## KB compliance rules (self-check before final)

- One Concept = One Home; link don't copy.

- Progressive learning order; atomic documents; boundaries in `#1`/`#7`.



## KB quality gates (evidence strictness)

Mirror `evidence_gates` in job plan:



- `#12`: ≥2 RFC/standards (or documented exception) + ≥1 OWASP or official guideline.

- Claims in `#7`, `#8`, `#10` map to evidence or `needs evidence` (≤20% top-level bullets).

- Anti-hallucination: verifiable references only.



## Prompt template



See [`docs/appsec-research-pipeline/prompt-template.md`](../../../docs/appsec-research-pipeline/prompt-template.md). Invoke:



```text

Use appsec-research-orchestrator (Mr P — Professional).

```



Batch example adds research fields; interactive/qa-only/single-role examples are in the same file.
